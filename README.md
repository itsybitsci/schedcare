The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly impacted people's ability to access healthcare services, with many individuals being reluctant to visit medical facilities for fear of contracting the virus. Teleconsultation technology has emerged as a solution to provide quality healthcare remotely, and its use is becoming increasingly common worldwide.

This study was able to develop a comprehensive system that integrates appointment scheduling and teleconsultation services, with the goal of reducing the risk of COVID-19 transmission. By utilizing teleconsultation as an alternative to in-person consultations, patients can access healthcare services from the safety and comfort of their own homes. Additionally, the system features a user-friendly web application that allows administrators to approve, block, or delete users ensuring that the system operates efficiently and securely. This facilitates the smooth delivery of healthcare services to patients, improving access to healthcare services for individuals affected by the pandemic. Overall, the system provides an innovative and effective solution to address the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, making healthcare more accessible and convenient for patients.
